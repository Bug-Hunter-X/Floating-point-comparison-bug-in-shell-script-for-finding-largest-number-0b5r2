# Shell Script Bug: Floating-Point Number Comparison

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a shell script designed to find the largest number within a file. The script uses the `bc` command for floating-point comparisons. The bug arises from the imprecision inherent in floating-point representation and the way `bc` handles comparisons, particularly when comparing numbers close to the limits of floating-point precision. The challenge is to identify and correct the flawed comparison logic to reliably handle diverse floating-point values.

## Bug Description:
The provided shell script aims to determine the largest number among a list of numbers present in a file. However, its comparison logic employing `bc` falters when encountering floating-point numbers. This can lead to incorrect identification of the largest number because of floating-point comparison issues.

## Solution:
The solution involves replacing the flawed comparison with a more robust method, avoiding direct floating-point comparison using `bc`.  This might involve using alternative tools designed for high-precision numerical computation, or applying a different algorithm altogether that minimizes the risk of floating-point errors.
